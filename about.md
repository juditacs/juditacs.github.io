My name is Judit √Åcs and I'm a PhD student at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
I'm interested in natural language processing, machine learning, Linux and basically anything related to programming.

Here is me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=rIStlyMAAAAJ&hl=en).


My official website is [here](http://avalon.aut.bme.hu/~judit/).
