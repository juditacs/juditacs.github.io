        </h2>
          <p>Most if not all NLP pipelines involve converting textual data to some kind of
numerical representation, which usually means mapping each token to an integer
with the restriction that the same token should always be represented with the
same number. So if the sentence <em>The cat is black</em> is represented as <code class="highlighter-rouge">[0, 1, 2,
3]</code>, then the representation of the sentence <em>The dog is white</em> should use the
same integer for <em>The</em> and <em>is</em> and use different ones for <em>dog</em> and <em>white</em>
such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">[0, 4, 2, 5]</code>. These representation are often called <em>one-hot</em>
encoding, since they are a shorthand for a long vector where exactly one
element is one and the rest are zero. In fact these lists can be directly used
to create dense one-hot matrices:</p>

        </h2>
          <p>Attention has become ubiquitous in sequence learning tasks such as machine
translation. We most often have to deal with variable length sequences but we
require each sequence in the same batch (or the same dataset) to be equal in
length if we want to represent them as a single tensor. Padding shorter
sentences to the same length as the longest one in the batch is the most common
solution for this problem.</p>

          <p>Creating word frequency lists is an easy task in most programming languages but how easy it is exactly?
And what are the performance trade-offs?
We played around with our favorite programming languages and got surprising results.
The experiment is still going, you can participate too. And please do.</p>
