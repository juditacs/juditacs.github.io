I started a word counting challenge a few months ago and it received a lot more
interest than I expected. Yes, I admit that I deliberately made the challenge
sound very easy thus more people would participate.

Currently there are 18 unique solution in 12 languages if you count Python2 and
3 separate languages. Over a dozen people contributed, I thank you all.

This has been an amazing experience for me, and I learnt a few valuable lessons
during this competition:

* I should have made the rules much clearer and much sooner.
* I should have decided on the test data sooner to avoid having 3-4 leaderboard
tables.
* I ended up adding half of the test cases later than announcing the
competition which was necessary but unfair.


# The final dataset

I used the Hungarian Wikipedia for the final experiments. Each solution was
tested on the first 5 million lines and later on the full Hungarian Wikipedia
TODO meret, sorok szama

Most of them performed well on the full dataset except:

* all Java versions seem to hang for hours and were killed (by me) after a day,
* the Javascript version runs out of memory (16GB).


# Can I still contribute?

Yes, you are welcome to contribute. However, I won't update this article with
your results. If a second wave of great solutions come, I might write a third
article.
